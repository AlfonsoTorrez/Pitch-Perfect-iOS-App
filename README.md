# iOSDevelopment

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of all the applications that I have worked on that pertain to iOS development. 

Brief descriptions of the applications I have been working on. Full descriptions and pictures can be found inside each appâ€™s README.md file. 


### Demo 1
+ My first iOS application which contained a simple segue that allowed a user to change the text on a label.
+ Created a small cocoa pod that included swift code that hid the keyboard. 

### Demo 2 
+ Application consisted in the use of a navigation controller and a table view.
+ The table view listed a few names of countries. When clicked they will take the user into a separate view controller to see their flags.
