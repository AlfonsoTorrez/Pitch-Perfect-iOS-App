# iOSDevelopment

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of all the applications that I have worked on that pertain to iOS development. 

Brief descriptions of the applications I have been working on. Full descriptions and pictures can be found inside each appâ€™s README.md file. 


### Demo 1 - Single Segue Application
+ My first iOS application which contained a simple segue that allowed a user to change the text on a label.
+ Created a small cocoa pod that included swift code that hid the keyboard.

### Demo 2 - Country Flags Application
+ Application consisted in the use of a navigation controller and a table view.
+ The table view listed a few names of countries. When clicked they will take the user into a separate view controller to see their flags.

### Demo 3 - DOTA API Application
+ Created an application that used a DOTA (Online game) API .
+ The name of the characters from DOTA appear on a table view. Selecting on the table view cells will allow the user to see more information about the characters.

### Demo 4 - Simple List Application
+ The application is used to save small messages on table view cells.
+ It used core data to store the messages, in order for them to be saved without them being deleted when the user exits the app.
