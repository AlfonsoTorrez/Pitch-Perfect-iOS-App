# PitchPerfect - Udacity Course
Course Link: <https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585>

### Overview:
This application serves as an introduction to Xcode and the Swift coding language. The use for this application is to record a conversation between two users and then alters the voices in the conversation. There are six different ways of changing the voices once the recording is done. Altered voices include slow, fast, high, low, echo, or reverb pitch. During the creation of the application I learned how to use the following technologies: 
+ Navigation Controller
+ AVFoundation Library 
+ Layout Constraints 
+ UIButton 
+ Segue Creation

### Functionality:
+ The homepage view controller of PitchPerfect. It contains a record and stop UIButton. The label between the the two buttons will change once one of the buttons is clicked on. Once the user is done record they will click on the stop button which will move them into the next view controller.
