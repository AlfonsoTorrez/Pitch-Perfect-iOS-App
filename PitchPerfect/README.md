### Overview:
This application serves as a introduction to Xcode and the Swift coding language. The use for this application is to record a conversation between two users and then alters the voices in the conversation. There are six different ways of changing the voices once the recording is done. Altered voices include slow, fast, high, low, echo, or reverb pitch. During the creation of the application I learned how to use the following technologies: 
+ Navigation Controller
+ AVFoundation Library 
+ Layout Constraints 
+ UIButton 
+ Segue Creation
